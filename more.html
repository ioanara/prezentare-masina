                <h2>Why not buy a new car?</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's society, the allure of purchasing a brand new car can be tempting. 
                    The shiny exterior, the latest technology, and the feeling of owning something brand new can be enticing. 
                    <br>
                    However, the reality is that buying a new car may not always be the best financial decision. 
                    In fact, there are several reasons why buying a new car can be a bad idea: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Prohibitive price</b> - new cars are expensive, a loan will take a while to pay off</li>
                    <li><b>Rapid depreciation</b> - new cars lose 30-50% of their value in the first few years after sale</li>
                    <li><b>That painful first scratch or dent</b> - that first ding will taint image of that shiny new car</li>
                    <li><b>Expensive maintenance</b> - oil, filters and catalysts make for an expensive upkeep</li>
                    <li><b>Expensive repairs</b> - new parts are expensive and mechanic labour cost is high due to their complexity</li>
                    <li><b>Useless features</b> - you're never going to use that Apple CarPlay, you have an old Android phone</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>But why would you buy an old, used car?</h2>
                <p>
                    Having gone through a few of the many downsides of buying a new car, our experts are here to give you an alternative: old, used cars!
                    <br>
                    Here are some of the most important advantages of older cars that you can benefit from today:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Low price and abundant</b> - older cars for sale are abundant on the market and as such they are cheap</li>
                    <li><b>Low depreciation</b> - practically no depreciation because their value is already bellow sea level</li>
                    <li><b>Cheap maintenance</b> - you won't lose your warranty if you fix it yourself or at your mechanic friend</li>
                    <li><b>Cheap replacement parts</b> - parts can be found in junkyards for cheap or you can buy anything that's on offer at the local wallmart</li>
                    <li><b>No useless features</b> - you don't pay for what you don't need, like fancy Lane assist, Cruise control or Airbags</li>
                    <li><b>Peace of mind</b> - it already has lots of dings, scratches and chips, one extra won't even get noticed</li>
                    <li><b>Upgrades and tuning options</b> - the longer they've been on the market, the more aftermarket parts are available</li>
                </ul>
